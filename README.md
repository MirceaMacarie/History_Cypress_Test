# History_Cypress_Test
This is my first automation test with Cypress automation tool, a modern framework for automation testing. In this respect, I organized a tests suite for the website of the Faculty of History and Philosophy from Babeș-Bolyai University, Cluj-Napoca, Romania.

## :pushpin: Inspiration and personal purpose :chart_with_upwards_trend:
This automation project was created to learn a new automation framework, Cypress. In order to apply practically my knowledge about Cypress, I chose to write some automation tests on various functionalities on the website of the Faculty of History and Philosophy, Babeș-Bolyai University, Cluj-Napoca, Romania.






## :pushpin: Project technologies :computer:
+ **JavaScript** as programming language
+ **Node.js** as runtime environment
+ **Cypress** as automation framework for web applications
+ **Google Chrome** as test browser

## :pushpin: Setup and installation :hammer_and_wrench:	
1. The first time I created a remote repository on GitHub, then a local repository on my computer.
2. In the project's local folder, I installed the **Cypress** automatic testing framework from the Command Prompt, by executing the command: "npm i cypress".
3. After the final installation of Cypress, I had to open it by command line "npx cypress open" in Command Prompt and configure the framework for this project: selecting the type of testing for this project (End-to-End Testing), selecting the Google Chrome browser to run the website, create and setting the specific folder of the JavaScript test code (in this case: **"cypress\e2e\History_Tests"**).
4. After we have finished configuring Cypress for this project, I open a JS code file in the **"cypress\e2e\History_Tests"** folder and add the unitary organized test suite with proper names for all the tests in it, following the documentation of Cypress framework.
5. The automated test suite is executed by running in the Cypress interface, with a generic report in the left and the visual execution of the tests in the right part. During execution, it is made a screenshot with the result of cross-site scripting verification on search box website. 

:arrow_right_hook: Here on GitHub, the JS file with Cypress tests is located in the folder: **cypress\e2e\History_Tests**. The screenshot is located in **cypress\screenshots**.





## :pushpin: Web support :link:
As support, I used **the website https://hiphi.ubbcluj.ro/** for these automation test.






## :pushpin: Testing objectives :microscope:
This project was thought as a way to: 
+ if **it respects a Positive Flow for a student who wants to search/ verify specific things on website**, 
+ **to check certain static details (buttons, titles, text, etc.)**,
+ check if **certain functions of the site can be automated** in a testing process.






## :pushpin: Demo video of the Automation test :clapper:
Below is the **video recording** of the automation tests execution, written for testing of Faculty of History BBU website.
