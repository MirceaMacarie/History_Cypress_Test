# History_Cypress_Test
This is my first automation test with Cypress automation tool, a modern framework for automation testing. In this respect, I organized a tests suite for the website of the Faculty of History and Philosophy from Babeș-Bolyai University, Cluj-Napoca, Romania.

## :pushpin: Inspiration and personal purpose :chart_with_upwards_trend:
This automation project was created to learn a new automation framework, Cypress. In order to apply practically my knowledge about Cypress, I chose to write some automation tests on various functionalities on the website of the Faculty of History and Philosophy, Babeș-Bolyai University, Cluj-Napoca, Romania.






## :pushpin: Project technologies :computer:
+ **JavaScript** as programming language
+ **Node.js** as runtime environment
+ **Cypress** as automation framework for web applications
+ **Google Chrome** as test browser, with chromedriver

## :pushpin: Setup and installation :hammer_and_wrench:	
1. The first time I created a remote repository on GitHub, then a local repository on my computer.
2. In the project's local folder, I installed the WebdriverIO automatic testing framework from the Command Terminal, by executing the command: "npm init wdio .".
3. Before the final installation of the drivers required for automated testing, I had to configure WebdriverIO by choosing certain options in the form in Terminal: selecting the base URL, using Google Chrome with chromedriver, setting the specific location where the files are located of the JavaScript test code ("./test/specs/**/*.js"), changing the command to run the test in the configuration file to "npm test".
4. After we have finished installing the necessary files, I open a JS code file in the "test/specs" folder and add the unitary organized test suite with proper names for all the tests in it, following the documentation of the WebdriverIO framework.
5. The automated test suite is executed by running the "npm test" command in the Command Terminal.






## :pushpin: Web support :link:
As support, I used **the website https://hiphi.ubbcluj.ro/** for these automation test.






## :pushpin: Testing objectives :microscope:
This project was thought as a way to: 
+ if **it respects a Positive Flow for a student who wants to search/ verify specific things on website**, 
+ **to check certain static details (buttons, titles, text, etc.)**,
+ check if **certain functions of the site can be automated** in a testing process.






## :pushpin: Demo videos of the Automation test :clapper:
Below is the video recording of the automation tests execution written for testing of Faculty of History BBU website.
